Before I used it my acne was awful mostly on my forehead but all around the rest of my face too. My dermatologist prescribed it to me and within a month of using it my acne completely cleared up. Now three years later I still use it and my face remains acne free.', \"I was breaking out badly on the sides of my cheeks then I couldn't take it anymore so I went to the dermo and they prescribed me Acanya. After 2 weeks I noticed a difference for sure. The big cysts I would get or just all these pimples I got in 1 spot started fading away instantly. It is take time I had to pop some and then put the cream on. It's been 3 months so far and no breakouts or acne whatsoever. I just use cetaphil and that medication and done. (:\", \"I LOVE this product. I suffered from breakouts (not horrible) but enough to make me self-conscious about. It does not make your face dry if anything it smooths it out. I use a tad in the morning and a whole pump at night all over my face. I haven't been getting pimples at all except for a few that were unnoticeable. And it worked almost immediately. I also paired this with Solodyn tablets 55mg for only the first month. Amazing. If anyone has mild breakouts then I strongly recommend these 2 products. Good luck. This may not work for everyone but if you have mild acne then I would go for it.\", \"I am 49 yrs old had cystic acne all my adult life. My dermatologist put me on Acanya 5 months ago and my skin looks the best it ever had.  My co-workers all think I am wearing makeup.  Have such large pores and they are shrinking too. No peeling I guess because I have oily skin.  But as an African American woman I didn't think I would ever find anything that would successfully help my skin. I am so grateful.  It just takes patience.\", \"I've always been hesitant to use acne medication in the morning because I felt like it would do nothing for me. Also I have to wear makeup before I leave the house so the only thing I usually have underneath my foundation is a moisturizer. I've added Acanya to my regime for the past week or so and my face has improved almost instantly. My pores look smaller and I haven't gotten any new bumps and the ones I already have are going away. I say stick to this product even if you don't see improvements at first. Hopefully I'll see more improvements\", 'My dermatologist gave me Acanya to use in the mornings. My acned improved a little in the beginning but then returned/got worse. It works differently for different people.', \"I've struggled with acne since I was about 13. I've used Proactive Clean &amp; Clear Neutrogena AcneFree etc. and every other acne system you can think of. \\r\\nThis product gets rid of my acne in about 4 days; it is all I need now. It doesn't matter what face wash or toners you use with this because all you need is the Acanya gel. It's pretty expensive but one bottle (only put on problem spots) lasts me about 4 months.\\r\\n\\r\\nAcanya has completely has kept my acne away for about a year now. As soon as you put it on the next morning the size of the bumps reduce in size dramatically. About a week later I had no acne. I didn't have bad skin I just needed the right product.\", \"I went to a new dermatologist because my acne is out of control.  I've had acne for 10 years and this is the worst it has ever been.  He gave me Acanya for the morning and it stings so bad I could cry.  My face turns red it's tight burning and not improving.  I've been using Acanya for almost a week I know results might take longer.  As for now I am not happy. Just be warned it is very drying and can make your day uncomfortable.\", \"awful product. did not do anything it was supposed to. I have very very mild acne. I wouldn't even call it acne just pimples. and everytime I have tried to use acanya it hasn't helped with any pimples and just left my face red and burned the next day. This redness stays for at least 4 days. It's so embarrassing and not worth it for a product that just makes your pimples MORE obvious because of HUGE red spots. awful product. throwing it in the garbage so I never have the idea of using it again.\", \"Also for the people saying it dries our your skin very badly you must be using too much. It does dry your skin out but not badly at all. You're supposed to use very very little bit of it on your acne. Not your whole face just your acne. I learned the hard way. I loaded it up on my chin &amp; it made my chin so dry &amp; itchy &amp; red. It looked horrible like my whole chin was scabbed. It went away after I stopped putting the cream on it for a day or two.\"]\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"QrzgG-domf-G"},"source":["df_new[\"review\"][test]"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"7g0COjBqZVKR","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1621720895971,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":8030080,"user":{"displayName":"Devesh

take this all the time just when i sense allergy season or plan to be somewhere where there is a change like the mountains or in an airplane it keeps my sinuses from swelling causing the headache it's not an instant fix it takes about 11 hours to be effective on mei have awful allergies and have since i was a kid at 30 years old i finally couldn't take it anymore and gave in and started taking medicine i take a prescription strength claritin and use flonase fluticasone propionate i really like it because it takes effect immediately i actually like the smell of it it cracks me up because it is for allergies yet smells like flowers i noticed it works best if you blow your nose first and use it first thing in the morning i did experience a mild nose bleed about a week into using it but haven't had one since and i have been using it 4 months polyps were better after 1 month of has saved my life i have always been a sneezing mess i constantly had a blocked nose more or less everyday i stupidly tried to use omg what a mistake as this infected my nose because i came reliant on it causing an inflamation so i went to the doctors who prescribed me avamys nose spray it saved my life i can breathe again and it treated my nose from inflammation and also protects it from any further complications all watery eyes and nose problems gone down the drain i would this medicine best nose spray i've ever had both generic and flonase work for me been using them for several years must use every day to see effectsi gave it a 5 out of 10 based just on my experience for two months it worked beautifully i felt so much better then i ended up with severe dizziness increased thirst and urination diarrhea weakness aches and pains also muscle spasms around the eyes and i believe higher blood pressure though i can't corroborate exactly all symptoms have gone away since quitting the one that's lingered the longest has been the increased thirst and urination apparently this medication can raise blood glucose levels in blood and urine triggering diabetes fortunately its been a little over a week since i stopped medication and those symptoms are getting better now too one day i counted i had to go to the bathroom 13 x's in a 12 hour period never again one squirt 5 mins later my vision was blurry my heart was racing my arms and legs felt like jello and 30 mins later i was having body aches all over the place like i had the flu will not be taking this medication ever againi was out on fluticasone for a severe cold with ear infection and thick head congestion that was quite persistent the doctor felt giving it a go might get the nasal passages open a bit to help with sinus pressure and fluid behind my eardrum after 10 days on it my symptoms worsened severe sore throat white patches on my throat bleeding nose and spasms that put me into coughing fits so bad i'd throw up and feel as though i would pass out from lack of air i chose to stop it 3 days ago after 2 days

worked just fine for me however i decided to try intuniv after my dr prescribed it for my daughter saying that it was better because it wasn't habit forming and that it wasn't a stimulant after 2 weeks of feeling extremely tired i then began to have headaches feel like i was going to collapse at any given moment and couldn't even drive due to the extreme comatose state i felt i was in my vision also became blurred and i was very dizzy i can see how this medication might benefit someone with adhd as it lowers blood pressure and seems to slow the person down but i don't recommend it for add it was a miserable nightmare i took my daughter off it as welli don't care for this medicine i developed a rash on both my arms and was so confused i don't suggest adults use this for adhdmy grandson has been on this for over a month he is a different person when he is on this he is not a good eater and never has been so the doctor weighs him a lot he is only 5 but you could not stand the person he was without medication he takes this with vyvanse and it is cerebral palsy my son is 8 years old and has started taking intuniv for his behavior concentration and mood swings he does have cp he has never been diagnosed with adhd so that concerned me when the neurologist wanted to put him on intuniv he's taking 1mg at night and i have to tell you he is a new boy he's cooperative sleeping well and he is doing better in 8 year old son was prescribed 2mg in the morning he has been on it for two weeks at first it helped him concentrate in school but he was still aggressive with his sister and others week two he now cries almost everyday at school and at home he constantly talks about death he keeps asking me if i will wait for him in heaven when i die it is awful to see my little boy go through this i took him off of it right away vyvanse worked for him a lot better at the lowest guanfacine for a week have not noticed any effects except maybe my son is more argumentative but it's not helping his adhd at all strattera works much better than guanfacine since he can't take the stimulants i recommend strattera to anyone else who has had a problem with side effects from ritalin or adderallmy son was diagnosed adhd in 4th grade he's now in 7th since that time we've tried many medications we finally settled on metadate and it worked great but we kept having to up the dosage until he's now on 60mg the doctor recommended adding intuniv to the metadate he was cranky and irritable the first week but now at week 3 and 2mg dosage the crankiness seems to be getting better what i have seen with intuniv is that he's very difficult to get up in the mornings but on a good note if i miss the metadate medication his behavior is still pretty good he's not bouncing all over the house when he's on both the medications he's doing really good i do have hopes to eventually get him off the stimulant all together \n","Original summary: back to her full 2mg dose ever since he he has been out

well and i have had to put adhesive tape around the edges of the patch to keep it on i don't know if i picked a bad spot middle of my stomach but certain ways it turn it seems to pinch i used nicotine patches years ago and it seems that if these patches were smaller and less rigid they might adhere a little better i like the idea of a patch lasting 3 4 days but i would prefer using one smaller patch a day if they stuck to the skin betteri absolutely love this patch thank you for putting it back on the shelves i am only 45 and had trouble since my hysterectomy several years ago in fact i was wearing a diaper to too sexy i admit these patches are awesome and have given me back my life they do get less sticky in the shower but i just face my body the other way the come off with no problem with goo gone or baby oil well worth iti recently started using the patch i have had to wear a pad everyday prior to using it i'm only on day 6 second patch and i feel like my life has changed i can walk exercise even sneeze and have no problem i was concerned about the adhesive because i have allergies and sensitive skin but i haven't had an issue i place the patch on my lower abdomen off to the side i removed the excess adhesive with baby oil and q tips it came right off i'll definitely keep using this seems to be the best medication for me i have only tried one other for the overactive

glad it is over the counter now i have worn the patch for one month now i am on my second box and will be purchasing a third a forth and so on oxytrol has changed my life back to normal no standing up and urine flowing out uncontrollably anymore no more 12 15 trips to the bathroom a day i travel and now i can drive for 2 3 hours at a time without stopping for a bathroom now i change the patch on day 4 i did try to hold out for the 4th night and while i did not have the urgency problem i did have to urinate more frequently than if i go four days and three nights the adhesive problems and the
